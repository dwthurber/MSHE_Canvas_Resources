        <h2>Welcome to MSHE!</h2>
        <p>We are so glad you have decided to begin the MSHE program. This site contains a wealth of information to help you get prepared to begin your graduate study. We have collected the most relevant resources under the &quot;Newly Admitted Student Resources&quot; section, but we recommend that you browse through all areas of the site.</p>

        <h4>New Student Checklist</h4>
        <p>Newly admitted students receive a &quot;new student checklist&quot; along with their acceptance letter and other materials. The checklist varies slightly for students who apply for the early admission deadline and students who apply for the regular admission deadline. The checklist is updated occasionally.&nbsp; Here are the most recent versions of the checklists:</p>
        <ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/q5qg9xtagdo9g55tyspk.pdf">Checklist for early admission students</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/hnibbw5ylisi3a3gyiu4.pdf">Checklist for regular admission matriculated students</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/wzdp1ea16zt3lt2wq6yq.pdf">Checklist for regular admission non-matriculated students</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>New students should also pay attention to the &quot;to-do lists&quot; that appear in the right hand navigation panel in CAESAR. Tasks on the CAESAR checklist may include things you need to do to have student loans disbursed or to enable you to register for courses. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to those items as well.</p><p>If you have any questions about any of the things listed here feel free to contact the MSHE office.</p>

        <h4>Orientation(s)</h4>
        <p>The MSHE program offers an in-person orientation once per year before the start of fall quarter for all new students (Fall 2015 in-person orientation is Sept. 17--more details forthcoming). There is also a new virtual orientation that is available on Canvas, and students will be added to this site and complete required modules to guide the transition to the program. &nbsp;The two types of orientation contain different information, and new students are strongly encouraged to participate in both types of orientation. Students will also have a chance to get to know their new classmates at the in-person orientation.</p>

        <h4>Outside Reading&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>It is a good idea to continue to build your knowledge base about topics and issues in higher education.</p>
        <p>One way to do this is to make a habit of reading the daily news from Inside Higher Ed and The Chronicle of Higher Education. Inside Higher Ed is free to anyone - you can go to their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.insidehighered.com/">website</a> to sign up for the daily newsletter and browse news archives. The Chronicle of Higher Education is a subscription publication. Northwestern University owns a subscription, so if you visit their <a target="_blank" href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">website</a> while you are on campus and connected to Northwestern&#39;s wireless network all of the content is free. If you are off campus you will need to connect to VPN in order to view articles on the Chronicle.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Furthermore, in keeping up with current research in the field, please familiarize yourself with the fields major peer-reviewed research journals. &nbsp;Journals can be accessed through Northwestern University electronic library holdings: <a href="http://www.ashe.ws/?page=174">The Review of Higher Education</a>&nbsp;(run by the Association&nbsp;for the Study of Higher Education), <a href="https://ohiostatepress.org/index.htm?journals/jhe/jhemain.htm">The Journal of Higher Education</a>&nbsp;(run by The Ohio State University Press), <a href="http://www.myacpa.org/journal-college-student-development">The Journal of College Student Development</a>&nbsp;(run by the American College Personnel Association), and a number of journals run by the <a href="http://www.naspa.org/publications/journals">Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education (NASPA)</a> professional organization.</p>
        <p>We have also compiled a <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/career-development-resources/suggested-reading-list">suggested reading list</a> of books and articles on this site. These are resources that were recommended by instructors, students and alumni of the program. If you have the time, it is wise to begin reading about the areas and topics of higher education that are of greatest interest to you. You may find that you are able to utilize this information in class discussions, cite it in papers, and potentially even cite it in your Master&#39;s Project.</p>
        <hr size="2" />
    <h4>Master&#39;s Project</h4>
    <p>Even if you will not be starting the Master&#39;s Project sequence your first quarter it is a good idea to begin thinking about what the topic of your research will be. Certainly all of the reading suggested above can help you get a jump start. Be sure to keep any sources that you think may be helpful for your master&#39;s project organized so that you can reference them when you begin to write your literature review in the first course of the Master&#39;s Project sequence.</p>
    <p>We also suggest that you begin keeping track of questions you have and things that you observe in your internship or workplace, in class or in conversations. We suggest keeping a small notebook with you so that you can easily jot down ideas.</p>
    <p>You can also look at Master&#39;s Projects that have been completed by students in the past. In addition to giving you some background on the format of the written project you can also use the cited references as a starting place for sources for your own literature review. A sampling of Master&#39;s Projects is available on the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/current-student-resources/the-master-s-project">Master&#39;s Project page</a> of this site.</p>

    <h4>Registering for Courses</h4>
    <p>Before registering for courses for the first time there are a few things to be aware of. In order to register for courses, the MSHE program must give you an &quot;enrollment appointment.&quot; Dr. Kristin McCann will process your enrollment appointment after receiving the Intention to Register form and the tuition deposit. Depending on when you applied and were accepted, enrollment for your starting quarter may not yet be open (e.g. if you were accepted in January and planning to start in the fall you wouldn&#39;t be able to register for courses until fall enrollment opened in late spring.) You will get an email from Kristin letting you know when your enrollment appointment has been set.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Students register for courses online through CAESAR. The CAESAR system can be a bit confusing at first, so we strongly recommend that new students attend a virtual orientation session before registering the first time.</p>
    <p>You can register for courses up to the end of the first week of classes, though it is a good idea to register well before classes start so that you can get access to the Canvas sites for your courses and get access to course materials. If you will be taking <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/curricular-requirements#TOC-Registering-for-elective-courses-outside-MSHE">electives outside of the MSHE program</a> it is also to your advantage to register early, as these classes could fill up. MSHE courses will not close because of enrollment capacity, so don&#39;t worry that you&#39;ll be blocked out of required courses because you applied or registered shortly before the start of the quarter.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/curricular-requirements#TOC-Course-Registration">Detailed information about course registration is available on the Academics and Curriculum page of this site</a>.</p>
