            <h4>Examples of Master's Projects</h4>
            <p>Below is a small selection of Master's Projects completed by Higher Education Administration and Policy students, grouped by topic. A project's inclusion in this list is not an indication that the project is without error. The goal of these samples is to provide students and alumni with samples on a variety of topics. Students and alumni may find it particularly useful to look at the bibliographies of projects on topics of interest and use those sources as a jumping off point for their own research. Every project listed here is shared with the permission of its author. However, to protect our students' work, the PDF's have been encrypted to prevent printing or saving the files. We also ask that no project be shared with anyone outside of the School of Education and Social Policy community without the permission of the author and the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program. Please contact <a href="mailto:ms-highered@northwestern.edu">ms-highered@northwestern.edu</a> with questions. </p>
