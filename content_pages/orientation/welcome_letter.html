<p>To help you get started and make the most of your graduate experiences, we have created this virtual orientation that will answer many of the questions you may have about getting started. Whether you are attending full-time or part- time, matriculated or non-matriculated, we recognize that you are embarking on an exciting life-changing journey that, at times, will surely seem overwhelming. We have created courses, materials, and events to help you prepare for this journey, and we hope you take advantage of all the resources available to you, including access to our staff, faculty, your student colleagues, alumni, and other people and resources at Northwestern University (NU) and other higher education institutions and organizations.</p>
<p>Included in this site orientation are some of those resources and suggestions to help you make a strong start. To begin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully read and review the content in the various modules of this orientation.</li>
<li>Reflect on your development objectives and start planning what your academic career will look like by drafting your program plan.</li>
<li>If you have not already met with me, please contact me <a href="mailto:l-trautvetter@northwestern.edu">l-trautvetter@northwestern.edu</a> to set up a meeting. â€¨</li>
</ul>
<p>While you can expect to work hard, know that you will be working hard with fellow students and faculty who are here to learn and enjoy learning together. We hope to see you at many of the community and social events that we offer to support your learning and networking throughout your time in the program. Also take advantage of other cultural, social, and athletic events offered at Northwestern University and in the Chicago area. These informal learning opportunities can be as important to your development as your coursework. And, if you want to initiate an event, brown bag, or other learning opportunity you haven&rsquo;t seen offered yet, please contact us.</p>
<p>You need to play a major role in shaping what your learning journey will be&mdash;so, don&rsquo;t wait for someone else to shape it for you. This is your chance to create the graduate program experience you&rsquo;ve been looking for.</p>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
