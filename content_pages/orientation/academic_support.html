<h3>Introduction to Research in Education</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://nucat.library.northwestern.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=4035711">ERIC (Education Resource Information Center) database</a> is probably the single best starting point for research in education. ERIC is a huge bibliographic database that lists virtually everything published related to education. This is the place to go to search for sources related to a topic you want to research for a paper or your Master&rsquo;s Project. You may or may not be able to access the actual source through ERIC if it is not public (e.g. a book or subscription-only journal), but this will help you find what&rsquo;s out there and then you can actually access it through the NU Library using the methods below. The <a href="http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?authtype=ip&amp;profile=ehost&amp;defaultdb=eax">Education Abstracts</a> and <a href="http://er.library.northwestern.edu/V/1D7M2JGK556ASCFJ3YGJIHA5ICCUPPNIBC8SKKJPCSN3FUT9BN-00063?func=native-link&amp;resource=NWU01963">Education Administration Abstracts</a> databases are also good bibliographic indexes. A &ldquo;Find it at NU&rdquo; button will often appear on the left-hand side when conducting a search in ERIC, Education Abstracts, or Education Administration Abstracts and the full-text articles are not available in the database you are using. Click on the icon, and it will lead you to the articles if NU subscribes to the publication. If NU does not have a subscription, you can request the article via <a href="http://www.library.northwestern.edu/services/getting-materials/interlibrary-loan/request-materials-through-ill">Interlibrary Loan</a>. For more information on &ldquo;Find it at NU&rdquo; watch the <a href="http://www.library.northwestern.edu/node/2730">video tutorial</a>.</p>
