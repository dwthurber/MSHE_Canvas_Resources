<h2>The Master's Project Sequence</h2>
<h4>MSHE 406 Research and Analysis I: Question Development and Literature Review</h4>
<p>In the first course of the Master's Project sequence, students identify the question that will guide their research. Most often the Master's Project Question grows out of a student's own experiences in higher education. Students then complete a literature review to connect their own research to research that has already been done on the topic.</p>
<h4>MSHE 407 Research and Analysis II: Research Methodology and Data Collection</h4>
<p>In the second course of the three-course Master's Project sequence, students will learn skills and techniques for collecting original data. Data collection methods include surveys, interviews, observation, and artifact/archival analysis. Students will then create a data collection plan and begin to gather data.</p>
<h4>MSHE 408 Research and Analysis III: Analysis, Interpretation, and Dissemination</h4>
<p>In the third course of the Master's Project sequence, students learn to systematically analyze and interpret collected data, including skills for reducing and displaying data in figures, charts and tables. They complete the written research report and make a formal presentation of findings.</p>

<p>Even if you will not be starting the Master's Project sequence your first quarter, it is a good idea to begin thinking about what the topic of your research will be. Certainly all of the reading suggested above can help you get a jump start. Be sure to keep any sources that you think may be helpful for your Master's Project organized so that you can reference them when you begin to write your literature review in the first course of the Master's Project sequence.</p>
<p>We also suggest that you begin keeping track of questions you have and things that you observe in your internship or workplace, in class or in conversations. We suggest keeping a small notebook with you so that you can easily jot down ideas.</p>
<p>You can also look at Master's Projects that have been completed by students in the past. In addition to giving you some background on the format of the written project, you can also use the cited references as a starting place for sources for your own literature review. A sampling of Master's Projects is available on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/current-student-resources/the-master-s-project" target="_blank">Master's Project page</a> of the MSHE student resources site.</p>
