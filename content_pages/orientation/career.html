<h2>Learning to (Best) Use LinkedIn</h2>
<p>It is easy to get started with the basics of LinkedIn. If you're at all familiar with social media you'll be able to figure out how to set up your profile without much trouble. However, most of LinkedIn's most useful features are a bit hidden. If you're a LinkedIn beginner, below are some short (5 minute) videos about how to use LinkedIn. These videos are targeted to college students who are beginning their job search, so they are highly relevant to MSHE students.</p>
