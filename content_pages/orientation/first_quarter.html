            <h3>New Student Checklist</h3>
            <p>Newly admitted students receive a "new student checklist" along with their acceptance letter and other materials. The checklist varies slightly for students who apply for the early admission deadline and students who apply for the regular admission deadline. The checklist is updated occasionally.&nbsp; Here are the most recent versions of the checklists:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/q5qg9xtagdo9g55tyspk.pdf" target="_blank">Checklist for early admission students</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/hnibbw5ylisi3a3gyiu4.pdf" target="_blank">Checklist for regular admission matriculated students</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/wzdp1ea16zt3lt2wq6yq.pdf" target="_blank">Checklist for regular admission non-matriculated students</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>New students should also pay attention to the "to-do lists" that appear in the right hand navigation panel in CAESAR. Tasks on the CAESAR checklist may include things you need to do to have student loans disbursed or to enable you to register for courses. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to those items as well.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about any of the things listed here feel free to contact the MSHE office.</p>

            <h3>Suggested First Steps</h3>
            <p>Soon enough you will have plenty of reading and assignments to keep you busy, but in the time before you begin taking classes it is a good idea to start building your knowledge base about topics and issues in higher education.</p>
            <p>The best way to do this is to make a habit of reading the daily news from Inside Higher Ed and The Chronicle of Higher Education. Inside Higher Ed is free to anyone - you can go to their <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/" target="_blank">website</a> to sign up for the daily newsletter and browse news archives. The Chronicle of Higher Education is a subscription publication. Northwestern University owns a subscription, so if you visit their <a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5" target="_blank">website</a> while you are on campus and connected to Northwestern's wireless network all of the content is free. If you are off campus you will need to connect to VPN in order to view articles on the Chronicle. </p>
                <p>We have also compiled a <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/career-development-resources/suggested-reading-list" target="_blank">suggested reading list</a> of books and articles on the MSHE student resources site. These are resources that were recommended by instructors, students and alumni of the program. If you have the time, it is wise to begin reading about the areas and topics of higher education that are of greatest interest to you. You may find that you are able to utilize this information in class discussions, cite it in papers, and potentially even cite it in your Master's Project.</p>
