    <h3>Registering for Courses</h3>
<p>Before registering for courses for the first time there are a few things to be aware of. In order to register for courses, the MSHE program must give you an "enrollment appointment." Dr. Kristin McCann (Assistant Director of MSHE) will process your enrollment appointment after receiving the Intention to Register form and the tuition deposit. Depending on when you applied and were accepted, enrollment for your starting quarter may not yet be open (e.g. if you were accepted in January and planning to start in the fall you wouldn't be able to register for courses until fall enrollment opened in late spring.) You will get an email from Kristin letting you know when your enrollment appointment has been set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students register for courses online through CAESAR. The CAESAR system can be a bit confusing at first, so we strongly recommend that new students attend a virtual orientation session before registering the first time.</p>
<p>You can register for courses up to the end of the first week of classes, though it is a good idea to register well before classes start so that you can get access to the Blackboard sites for your courses and get access to course materials. If you will be taking <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/curricular-requirements#TOC-Registering-for-elective-courses-outside-MSHE" target="_blank">electives outside of the MSHE program</a> it is also to your advantage to register early, as these classes could fill up. MSHE courses will not close because of enrollment capacity, so don't worry that you'll be blocked out of required courses because you applied or registered shortly before the start of the quarter.</p>
<p>Detailed information about course registration is available on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/curricular-requirements#TOC-Course-Registration">Academics and Curriculum page</a> of the student resources site.</p>

<h3>Getting Books for Classes</h3>
<p>Information about what (if any) books are required for a course is available on the course's syllabus on Canvas. You can either elect to buy/rent your books from the Northwestern bookstore or use the information to find the book through another retailer (e.g. <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://half.com">half.com</a>.) Make special note of the ISBN number for textbooks to make sure that you are purchasing the correct edition. Another way to get books (for free!) is to try using UBorrow or the Interlibrary loan through the NU library.</p>
<p>HESA also organizes a book exchange each quarter for students to buy books from other MSHE students. HESA typically sends an email each academic quarter to all MSHE students with more information about this exchange.</p>
