<p>The <a href="http://maps.northwestern.edu/#latlngz=41.972%2C-87.655%2C12">interactive campus map</a> allows you to search for buildings on the Evanston or Chicago campus by name or address.

<h4><a name="TOC-Campus-Tours"></a>Campus Tours</h4>
<p>The NU Office of Undergraduate Admission offers tours of the campus every day (and twice a day in the summers). The tours are preceded by a 45 minute information session, which is focused on information for prospective undergraduates. You can sign up for tours and see the times that tours are offered <a href="http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/visit/plan-your-visit/visit-calendar.html" target="_blank">here</a>. If you plan to attend the tour but not the information session you should arrive at the admission office 40 minutes after the time of the information session.</p>
