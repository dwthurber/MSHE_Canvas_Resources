By integrating classroom and experiential learning, students are challenged to apply theoretical knowledge to inform professional practice and cultivate questions from practice to illuminate and validate theory. Internships enhance the overall academic and professional preparation and employment credentials of graduates and are an important aspect of students&rsquo; career development. Students are therefore required to complete a credit-bearing internship of at least 200 hours, or approximately 20 hours per week for 10 weeks.</p><hr /></div><h3>What Interns Do</h3><table style="border-color: #4e015c; float: right;" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #4e015c; width: 0.5px;" valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><div><span style="font-size: 18.6666660308838px;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Student Perspectives:</span></em>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 18.6666660308838px;">The Internship Experience</span></div><div><a class="wistia-popover[height=360,playerColor=7b796a,width=640]" href="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uwriyzy0dd?popover=true"><img alt="" src="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/29a35fc3b5dbfcae0230ffea5f47a48e1a4c90bc.jpg?image_play_button=true&amp;image_play_button_color=7b796ae0&amp;image_crop_resized=200x113" /></a> <script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/popover-v1.js"></script></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In order to obtain academic credit, MSHE interns must do significant work for an organization. Because of their qualifications, experience and energy, interns are often assigned a great deal of responsibility. Tasks and projects that MSHE students have completed recently include the following:</p><ul><li>Planning events</li><li>Designing programs for students, staff and faculty</li><li>Managing projects</li><li>Improving/streamlining operations</li><li>Advising students and student groups/organizations</li><li>Designing educational programs&nbsp;</li><li>Evaluating programs &ndash; qualitatively and quantitatively&nbsp;</li><li>Improving and/or streamlining operations&nbsp;</li><li>Managing projects&nbsp;</li><li>Creating and implementing marketing campaigns&nbsp;</li><li>Creating assessment tools&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring policy and legislative initiatives&nbsp;</li><li>Researching best practices&nbsp;</li><li>Developing and distributing surveys; analyzing and presenting results&nbsp;</li><li>Conducting strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) and information analyses&nbsp;</li><li>Developing databases&nbsp;</li><li>Leading and being a member of teams.</li></ul><hr /><h3>Getting Academic Credit for the Internship</h3><p>In order to get academic credit for the internship you must register for the internship course (MS_HE 485). You will need a permission number to register. To get the permission number be sure that you have turned in your internship contract and then contact Kristin McCann at <a href="mailto:kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu">kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu</a> to request the permission number.</p><p>At the end of the quarter you must submit the following items to Lois Trautvetter:</p><ol><li>Completed and signed <a href="http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/HEAP_InternshipEval.pdf">evaluation form</a>&nbsp; (submitted by the supervisor)</li><li>Portfolio of work products</li><li>A five- to eight-page paper reflecting on the internship experience</li></ol><hr /><h3>Before the Internship</h3><p>Students should begin planning for their internship at least one quarter prior to the quarter in which they plan to register for the internship. There are several ways in which students can connect with potential internship employers:</p><ol><li>Contact Lois Trautvetter at <a href="mailto:%20%6c-%74%72%61%75%74%76%65%74%74%65%72@%6e%6f%72%74%68%77%65%73%74%65%72%6e.%65%64%75">l-trautvetter@northwestern.edu</a> at least one quarter prior to the quarter in which you want to intern and receive an updated list of institutions and departments seeking an intern. The MSHE Program maintains a database of opportunities appropriate for its students.</li><li>Send a cover letter and resume to employers of interest. If an employer has not hosted a MSHE intern before, it is helpful to note the types of projects you could do for the employer and/or refer the employer to the Internship Handbook.</li><li>Consult with Lois Trautvetter for additional ideas. Students may have project ideas but not know which employers to target, or they may know the department in which they want to work but not know what types of projects would be available in that department. In either case, the MSHE staff are available to help students get connected with desired employers.</li></ol><p>The internship search, like any job search, can take time and effort. The Higher Education Administration and Policy staff will assist you with this process as much as possible, and <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/careers/">University Career Services</a> can be another useful source of information, internship listings and advice.</p><p>Students may interview with a number of employers prior to accepting an internship offer. Please remember to send thank-you notes after each interview. Besides being the polite thing to do, this act of courtesy can help applicants be remembered in a positive</p><p>Once students have accepted an internship offer, they work with the internship supervisor to complete an <a href="http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/HEAP_InternshipContract.pdf">internship contract</a> that outlines the duties to be performed by the student and the objectives that the internship is designed to meet.</p><hr /><h3>Waiving the Internship</h3><p>Students who have significant experience in the field of higher education may petition to waive the internship by completing the <strong>Petition to Waive the Internship Form</strong> (see the link at the top of this page to download the form)&nbsp; and submitting it to the program Director. If the petition is approved the student will take an additional elective in place of the internship course.</p></div>
