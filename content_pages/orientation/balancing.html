<h3>Difference Between Full Time and Part Time</h3>
<p>3 or 4 classes per quarter constitute a full-time course load.&nbsp; Students who take 4 classes per quarter can complete the degree in one calendar year and must begin in the summer or fall quarter.&nbsp; Students who take 3 classes per quarter can complete the degree in five quarters and may start in any quarter. The program's schedule is very flexible, so students can switch between part-time to full-time status in any quarter. Most required courses are only offered in one quarter and the Master's Research Project courses must be taken in sequential order, but most of the other classes don't have prerequisites. All students have an initial meeting with Lois, the Director, to set their plan for what courses they will take each quarter, but each student also can meet with Kristin, the academic advisor, who can help them adjust that plan as necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Course and Class Schedule</h3>
<p>All required courses meet on the Evanston campus in the evening. Required courses each meet once per week, typically from 6-9pm. This allows students to pursue internships and full-time jobs in higher education administration during the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are allowed to take elective courses through other programs and schools at Northwestern (with advisor approval), and those courses may meet on the Chicago campus or during the daytime</p>
