    <h2>Parking and Transportation</h2>
<h4>Inter-campus Shuttle</h4>
<p> The Inter-campus shuttle is a free service for students, faculty and staff. The shuttle makes stops in Evanston, at Loyola University Chicago and at Northwestern's downtown campus. Riders must show their Wildcard. <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/uservices/transportation/shuttles/intercampus/intercampus.html" target="_blank">See details and schedules.</a></p>
<h4> Northwestern Campus Parking</h4>
<p> Most parking lots on Northwestern's campus do not require a permit to park after 4pm. However, some parking lots (and some parking spaces within lots) require a permit at all times. Most students who will be on campus only for courses held in the evenings do not purchase parking permits. When parking on campus at night make note of signs that are posted at the entrance of parking lots to ensure that you won't be ticketed. The parking lots nearest Annenberg Hall are the lots at Garrett Seminary, the Sports and Aquatic Center and the parking garage to the north of the Norris University Center. <a href="http://maps.northwestern.edu/#latlngz=42.052%2C-87.674%2C17">See parking maps</a>.</p>
<p> To purchase a parking permit or pay or contest a parking ticket contact the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/up/parking/index.html" target="_blank">Northwestern University Parking Office</a>.</p>
<h4> Public Transportation: CTA - Chicago Transit Authority</h4>
<p> The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) operates the nation's second largest public transportation system--a regional transit system that serves the City of Chicago and 40 neighboring communities. The CTA's system of trains and buses can get you to almost anywhere in the Chicago area. <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/service_overview.aspx">See CTA schedules and maps</a>. The CTA also has a "trip planner" feature where you can get detailed directions to and from anywhere in the Chicago area.</p>
<p> Note: The closest train stations to Annenberg Hall are the Foster and Noyes Purple Line stops.</p>
<p> Frequent CTA users may want to consider getting the <a href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/" target="_blank">Ventra Card</a> which automatically draws money from your bank account to ensure that you always have train and bus fare.</p>
<h4> Public Transportation: Metra</h4>
<p> The Metra is a public train system that serves Chicago and many suburbs. The Metra has fewer stations than the CTA, making it faster and easier to get to and from more remote suburbs and areas of Chicago that are not close to CTA stations. <a href="http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home.html" target="_blank">See routes and schedules</a>. </p>
<h4>Chicago Bike Map</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/cityinfo/cdot/bikemap/keymap.html" target="_blank">The Chicago Bike Map</a> is organized by neighborhood and includes important information for safe biking in the city. </p>
