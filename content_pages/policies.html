    <h2>Introduction to the Program</h2> 
    <p>The Master of Science in Higher Education Administration &amp; Policy Program (MSHE), located within the School of Education and Social Policy (SESP) at Northwestern University, is a learning community composed of scholars, practitioners, and students. We develop students to have the knowledge and skills they require to successfully transform colleges, universities, and related organizations and become leaders in the field of higher education. As a learning community we value collaboration, honesty and respect. Many of the policies and procedures that govern our community can be found on this page.</p>
    <h3>Academic Status Policies</h3>
    <h4>Matriculated vs. Non-Matriculated</h4>
    <p>Students are accepted into the program with the status of either “matriculated” or “non-matriculated” based on the application they completed. Non-matriculated (in other words, non-degree) students are not yet candidates for the master's degree but can take up to four classes in the MSHE program before they must apply to matriculate or cease taking courses.</p>
    <p>In terms of student experience, no distinction is made between matriculated and non-matriculated students. The difference lies in the choice of classes: non-matriculated students may take up to four MSHE core or elective courses, excluding the research sequence (MSHE 406,407,and 408) and the internship course (MSHE 485). All classes that non-matriculated students successfully complete are applied toward the full degree requirements if and when the student matriculates.</p>
    <p>Non-matriculated students may also take advantage of career preparation services and other events offered to MSHE students.</p>
    <p>Non-matriculated students must meet with the Director of the MSHE program, Dr. Lois Trautvetter, before submitting their application to matriculate. More details about applying to matriculate are available on this site on the "<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/current-student-resources/resources-for-non-matriculated-students">Information for Non-Matriculated Students</a>" page.</p>
    <h4>Full-Time vs. Part-Time</h4>
    <p>Students may attend the Higher Education Administration and Policy Program either part-time or full-time. Part-time attendance means that the student is taking one or two courses each quarter. Full-time attendance means the student is taking three or four courses each quarter. Students may change their enrollment from part-time to full-time (or vice versa) from one quarter to the next. </p>
    <p>Full-time students may have different access to some services than part-time students. One example is that full-time students have free access to Northwestern's Sports and Aquatic Center, while part-time students must pay to use the facilities.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that full-time status (or eligibility for certain services) may be determined differently for different entities. One example is that the Health Services Office requires medical records for students who are enrolled full-time or half-time (2 courses per quarter) but not for students enrolled in only one class per term. Eligibility for federal student loans is based on half-time enrollment (2 courses per quarter).</p>
    <h4>Academic Progress and Program Completion</h4>
    <p>The amount of time it takes for a student to complete the master's degree depends upon how many courses the student takes and passes in each quarter. The minimum amount of time to complete the program is four academic quarters. Students must complete the master's degree within five years of matriculating. Students who have not completed the program requirements within the five year time span must meet with the program Director to discuss options.</p>
    <h4>Inactive Status</h4>
    <p>Students who are not enrolled in any courses in a quarter other than summer are considered inactive. Inactive students can still attend program events and will be on the student listserv. A student who is inactive for four consecutive quarters (not including summer) will be withdrawn from the program. Once a student is withdrawn they are no longer considered a student in the program and will be removed from the departmental listserv.</p>
    <h4>Withdrawing from the MSHE Program</h4>
    <p>If you no longer wish to continue as a student in the MSHE program please contact Dr. Kristin McCann at kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu. Kristin will assist you in filling out a paper form to terminate your status as a student in the program. Please note that this process is the same for matriculated and non-matriculated students.</p>
    <h4>Re-Entry for Withdrawn Students</h4>
    <p>Students who have been withdrawn can re-enter the program within five years of the date they matriculated. To re-enter the student must submit the <a href="https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/fca5zpi8j9zuwmvtvur8.pdf">Petition to Re-Enter form</a> and a $25 fee to the MSHE program office.</p>
    <p>If it has been more than five years since the date that the student matriculated they may have to re-apply for admission to the program.</p>
    <h4>Dropping a Course</h4>
    <p>Discuss all changes in your academic plans with your MSHE academic advisor, including a decision to add or drop a class. Students should add and drop courses during the first five days of the quarter (known as add/drop week). You can drop a course on CAESAR, provided you will still be enrolled in at least one course after you drop the course (if this is not the case see "withdrawing from an academic quarter" below.)</p>
    <p>Students will not be charged tuition for courses dropped in the first five days of the quarter. The University cannot give refunds or reduce tuition bills for any course dropped after the fifth day of classes. Please note that the policies regarding dropping some (but not all) courses in a quarter differ from the policies related to withdrawing from a quarter (dropping all courses in which you are enrolled). You can find the official Northwestern Policy about tuition refunds on the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/tuition/registration_refunds.html#Refunds2">Student Financial Services website</a>.</p>
    <p>Courses dropped after the first five days of classes (add/drop week) but before the "last day to drop" date will not appear on your transcript or impact GPA, but (as mentioned above) you will be charged tuition. To see the add/drop and final drop deadlines for each quarter <a href="http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration/index.html">visit the registrar's website</a>. Also, see "<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/mshe/home/current-student-resources/policies-and-regulations#TOC-Grades-for-Dropped-Courses">grades for dropped courses</a>" below.</p>
    <h5>Cancellation (dropping all of your courses in a quarter)</h5>
    <p>If you will be dropping all of your courses in a quarter you will not be able to do so in CAESAR. You should contact Dr. Kristin McCann at <a href="mailto:kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu">kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu</a> and she will fill out a paper form to drop you from your courses. This includes cases where students were signed up for only one course and then needed to drop the course.</p>
    <h5>Transfer Credit</h5>
    <p>The MSHE program does not allow transfer credits from other universities. All students must take 15 graduate-level courses to earn the master's degree. If you have taken a course in another graduate program that is the same as one of the required MSHE courses, you can petition to waive the course and take an elective in its place.</p>
    <h3>FERPA and Right to Privacy</h3>
    <p>The MSHE Program follows the Northwestern University guidelines for access to student records and directory information, which are based on the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974. For additional information, see <a href="http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/FERPA_policy.html">www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/FERPA_policy.html</a></p>
    <h3>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h3>
    <p>In compliance with Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, Northwestern University is committed to providing equal access to all programming. Students with disabilities seeking accommodations are encouraged to contact the office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 467-5530 or <a href="mailto:ssd@northwestern.edu">ssd@northwestern.edu</a>. SSD is located in the basement of Scott Hall. The SSD weblink is: <a href="http://www.stuaff.northwestern.edu/ssd/">http://www.stuaff.northwestern.edu/ssd/</a>.</p>
    <h3>Grading and Academic Expectations</h3>
    <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
    <p>As an MSHE student, you have entered a community of scholarship in which academic integrity is of the highest value. All students enrolled in the MSHE Program are expected to adhere to the standards for academic integrity. We specially address the policies of academic integrity because of the serious nature of violations: a violation of academic integrity guidelines for MSHE and Northwestern University can lead to a reduced or failing grade in the course (as determined by the course instructor), suspension and dismissal from the MSHE program. Students who violate these standards will be sanctioned as is deemed appropriate by the course instructor, the MSHE Program Director, and the Dean of the School of Education and Social Policy.</p>
    <p>It is very important, therefore, that you understand the definitions and examples of academic integrity. The MSHE program adheres to the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/students/integrity/">academic integrity policies set forth by Northwestern University</a>.  If you have any questions about academic dishonesty, please contact your MSHE Academic Advisor or the Program Director.</p>
    <p>Instructors commonly choose to use the “Safe Assignment” tool provided by the University that allows easy review of students’ written work against a large database of published, scholarly work to check for plagiarism. Students are expected to be conversant with current guidelines for proper citation of others’ work. The MSHE Program adheres to American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines.</p>
    <h4>Grading</h4>
    <p>Criteria for and evaluation of performance are at the discretion of the instructor. Expectations and how they are being met will be communicated to students via the course syllabus and feedback throughout the term. If you need clarity regarding expectations for class participation, team work or course deliverables, please discuss them with your respective instructor.</p>
    <p>Class Attendance It is expected that students should plan to attend all class meetings. Of course, there are occasions where students need to miss a class. If you need to miss a class because of an illness or emergency contact your instructor as soon as possible to let them know that you cannot be in class. Some instructors may assign additional work to make up for the absence. If you have to miss a class for a scheduled event (work, a conference, travel) discuss the issue with your instructor as soon as you  can, preferably before the start of the quarter. We recommend that if you know that you will have to miss more than two class meetings, you should not enroll in the course. The instructor for the course has overall discretion regarding how your overall grade for the class will be impacted due to absences.</p>
    <h4>Grade Changes</h4>
    <p>A student or instructor may request a grade change, most often to correct a clerical or computational error or to change an incomplete grade to a final grade. The right and responsibility to assess the quality of your work remains with your instructor. If you are dissatisfied with your grade in a class, we encourage you to communicate with the instructor. If you remain dissatisfied, you may contact the Director of the program. However, the Director does not have the authority to change a grade assigned by an instructor without the consent of the instructor.</p>
    <p>Taking an Incomplete (Y Grades)</p>
    <p>In general, students are expected to complete all work in all courses by the appropriate deadline, as outlined in each course's syllabus. However, there are occasions where a student is unable to complete their coursework before the end of the quarter (for example, due to an illness or family emergency.) In these cases students may be able to take an incomplete in the course and finish the course requirements at a later date.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that you must get the permission of the instructor to take an incomplete in a course. You and the instructor must agree upon a time when you will finish the work for the course. If you do not communicate with the instructor and fail to turn in final assignments or attend classes an "F" grade may be assigned.</p>
    <p>Incomplete courses appear as a “Y” grade on your transcript and count as an "F" in your GPA. Once you have turned in all of your work and your instructor has submitted a grade change the "Y" will be completely replaced by the new grade.</p>
    <p>We highly recommend that you reconcile "Y" grades within one quarter. Students who are receiving federal student loans should also be aware of how the Y grade impacts their eligibility in regards to the <a href="https://sesp.box.com/shared/static/8f37c2ec2978b0130140.pdf">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a> guidelines. You must resolve the incomplete grade within one year from the term in which you earned the "Y" grade or the "Y" will be permanent (exceptions may be made in the case of a medical leave of absence).  For instance, if you receive an incomplete in a course during the fall term, you must complete the work, and your instructor must submit a change of grade request by the end of finals week during the following fall term. <a href="http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/Change-Of-Grade-Policies.html">See the official NU policy on resolving Y grades here</a>.</p>
    <h4>Grades for Dropped Courses</h4>
    <p>Withdrawals in the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters with an "Effective Date" through the end of the 6th week of classes will result in an entry on the transcript documenting the withdrawal date. Withdrawals with an "Effective Date" after the end of the 6th week will result in the withdrawn courses, with grades of "W", being listed on the transcript along with the withdrawal date.</p>
    <p>Pass/No Pass All eleven required MSHE courses and all electives must be taken for a grade. There is not a pass/no pass (P/N) option for these courses. If you elect to take a course as pass/no pass during your time as an MSHE student, that course will not count toward the 15 courses required to earn the degree.</p>
    <h4>Auditing Courses</h4>
    <p>In general, auditing MSHE courses is not permitted. If you have questions please contact the Program Director.</p>

    <h3>Academic Probation </h3>
    <p>In matters regarding satisfactory academic progress and parameters for academic probation, the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program utilizes the <a href="http://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/about/policies/general-registration-policies.html#grades">policies established by The Graduate School at Northwestern University</a>.  The decision to place a student on academic probation or dismiss him or her from the program is at the discretion of the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program Director.</p>
